We're not totally sure yet, but it's a community service intended to provide support to our peers going through the experience of opening a relationship.

It could look like going on a walk for an hour and providing a space to ask questions, or a coffee shop date to gossip and vent, or a Zoom call, or a format we haven't thought of yet.

It's a new idea we're trying, so the details are up to you and us to figure out together!",

            description: "
We’re starting *ENM Peer Support* because we wish we had had peers who’d gone through similar experiences to talk to when we were opening our relationships.

Throughout our non-monogamy journeys, we’ve found it helpful to hear the stories and perspectives of other people who had opened up their relationships. Everyone’s experience is different, but we can learn a lot from each other."

            title: "Does it cost money?",
            description: "
No, *ENM Peer Support* is a community service offered for free.

However, we follow the mutual aid model of neighbors helping neighbors, so if you find our time together to be helpful and would like to help us in return, we do encourage monetary donations commensurate with your financial situation and how valuable you feel the service is for you."

            description: "
Well, to start, we're not trained or licensed therapists, so you should not seek that kind of support from *ENM Peer Support*.

If you can access couple's therapy, we highly encourage you to do that; we've found it immensely helpful to our non-monogamy journeys. *ENM Peer Support* is meant to be a more casual supplement for you to hear others' tales of relationship-opening and to learn from their experiences.

Yes! Your personal information and the stories you share during our time together will stay between us.

We know sharing about relationship challenges and insecurities can be vulnerable and we want to honor that and foster trust and safety between parties. We ask that you act in-kind towards us!"
