      "description": "_ENM Peer Support_ is a community service providing support to our peers going through the experience of opening a relationship.\n\nIt's a new idea we're trying, so the details of our engagement are up to you and us to figure out together: it could look like going on a walk for an hour and providing a space to ask questions, or a coffee shop date to vent and comfort, or a Zoom call, or some other format we haven't thought of yet!",

    },
    {
      "title": "Why are you offering this?",
      "description": "We’re starting _ENM Peer Support_ because we wish we had had peers who’d gone through similar experiences to talk to when we were opening our relationships. Most of the non-monogamous people we knew were solo poly, and most of our coupled friends thought we were crazy for trying ENM.\n\nThroughout our non-monogamy journeys, we’ve found it helpful to hear the stories and perspectives of other people who had opened up their relationships. Everyone’s experience is different, but we can learn a lot from each other.",

      "title": "Does it cost money?",
      "description": "No, _ENM Peer Support_ is a community service offered for free.\n\nHowever, we follow the mutual aid model of neighbors helping neighbors, so if you find our time together to be helpful and would like to help us in return, we do encourage monetary donations commensurate with your financial situation and how valuable the service is to you.",

      "title": "How is this different from couple's therapy?",
      "description": "Well, to start, we're not trained or licensed therapists, so you should not seek that kind of support from _ENM Peer Support_.\n\nIf you can access couple's therapy, we highly encourage you to do that; professional mediation can be very helpful when challenges arise between partners.\n\n_ENM Peer Support_ is meant to be a more casual supplement for you to hear others' tales of relationship-opening and to learn from their experiences.",

    {
      "title": "Will you keep our secrets?",
      "description": "Yes! Your personal information and the stories you share during our time together will stay between us.\n\nWe know sharing about relationship challenges and insecurities can be vulnerable and we want to honor that and foster trust and safety between parties. We ask that you act in-kind towards us!",

      "description": "No! We just thought it would make a silly and attention-grabbing poster design since Logan Square is often teased as being the center of Chicago's bisexual, non-monogamy culture.",
